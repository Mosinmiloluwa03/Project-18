<div id="section1" class="container-fluid">
  <h1>Cauliflower</h1>
  <p>Cauliflower is one of several vegetables cultivated from the species Brassica oleracea in the genus Brassica, which is in the Brassicaceae (or mustard) family.

    An annual plant that reproduces by seed, the cauliflower head is composed of a (generally) white inflorescence meristem. Cauliflower heads resemble those in broccoli, which differs in having flower buds as the edible portion. </p>
  <p>Cauliflower is relatively difficult to grow compared to cabbage, with common problems such as an underdeveloped head and poor curd quality.</p>
</div>
<div id="section2" class="container-fluid">
  <h1>Eggplant</h1>
  <p>Eggplant (US, CA, AU, NZ, PH), aubergine (UK, IE), brinjal (IN, SG, MY, ZA), or baigan (IN, GY) is a plant species in the nightshade family Solanaceae. Solanum melongena is grown worldwide for its edible fruit. </p>
  <p>Most commonly purple, the spongy, absorbent fruit is used in several cuisines. Typically used as a vegetable in cooking, it is a berry by botanical definition. As a member of the genus Solanum, it is related to the tomato, chili pepper, and potato, although those are of the New World while the eggplant is of the Old World. Like the tomato, its skin and seeds can be eaten, but it is usually eaten cooked. Eggplant is nutritionally low in macronutrient and micronutrient content, but the capability of the fruit to absorb oils and flavors into its flesh through cooking expands its use in the culinary arts. </p>
</div>
<div id="section3" class="container-fluid">
  <h1>Cucumber</h1>
  <p>The cucumber (Cucumis sativus) is a widely-cultivated creeping vine plant in the family Cucurbitaceae that bears cylindrical to spherical fruits, which are used as culinary vegetables</p>
  <p>The cucumber is a creeping vine that roots in the ground and grows up trellises or other supporting frames, wrapping around supports with thin, spiraling tendrils.</p>
